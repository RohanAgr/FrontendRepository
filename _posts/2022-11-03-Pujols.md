- Albert Pujols was a DH / First Baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals, the Los Angeles Angels, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. He played his final season with the Cardinals in 2022, coming full circle. He also breached the 700 career home runs mark, totaling 703 in his legendary 21-season career. During the All-Star Break, no one expected him to breach the 700 home run mark, but he started hitting home runs regularly during the months of August and September. He was a major factor in the Cardinals' postseason push.
