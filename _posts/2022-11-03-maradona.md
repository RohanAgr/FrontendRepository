Diego Maradona was born on October 30, 1960 in Argentina and unfortunately died November 25, 2020. He was known for doing advanced skills and being a free kick specialist in which he earned the name “El Pibe de Oro”. His career has consisted of being on the teams 	Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla, Newell's Old Boys, and the Boca Juniors. The most notable achievement was when he won the 1986 World Cup. At the time, he set the record for most expensive player, with a transfer value of £6.9 million. In his career, he scored 352 goals and 226 assists. His name is still notable today when soccer players use his iconic “Maradona” spin in their set of skills (shown in video).
