title: Baseball Manny Machado
---
- Manny Machado is a 30-year old third baseman who plays for the San Diego Padres. He is known for his stellar defense and timely hitting. Ever since he took the field as a Baltimore Oriole at the age of 17, he has been a sensation. He homered in only his second career game, and played insane defense. Before signing with the Padres, he was known as "the villain of baseball" for the aggressive and bully-like manner in which he played. 
- In 2019, he signed a 10 year, $300 million deal with the Padres, and he was given the role as a mentor. Several people have noticed his growing maturity and the way he puts the Padres on his back.
