- Julio Rodriguez is a 21 year old center fielder for the Seattle Mariners. The 2022 season was his rookie season, and he was a sensation. During Spring Training, he earned his spot on the opening day roster, and from then onwards he did not look back. The rookie was productive for the Mariners, as he got on base a lot as well as motivating the team. Some say that he was the catalyst the Mariners needed to clinch a postseason berth for the first time since 2001.
